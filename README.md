# Design Detailed Document (DDD)

## Description of the Project

My project, is a website developed fully by me. It serves as a platform to explore and showcase various aspects. The technology stack includes HTML and CSS, and the key point of this proyect is to learn how to set up a proyect, strcture it and program in html and cssS.

## Problems During Development

### GitHub Setup

Setting up the project on GitHub presented a minor challenge due to multiple errors with github not correctly finding paths to files. Overcoming this involved searching in the internet for solutions, in the end I opted for starting and setting a new repository ensuring a smooth collaboration and setup.

### Responsive Design Challenges

A significant obstacle encountered during the development process was obtaining responsive design, specifically concerning HTML and CSS centering components. When I opened my webpage on a separate PC, I discovered that none of the elements were centered as they should have been. To fix this, I utilized pixels and relative positioning to locate and center each element. This was fixed by switching all of the code to margins with the appropriate percentage rather than pixels, which ensured a logical and user-friendly layout on a range of screen sizes.

## Conclusions

The project proved to be a relatively smooth experience overall. Despite minimal challenges, the learning outcomes were significant.

### Key Learnings

- **CSS Mastery:** The project provided a valuable opportunity to learn more into CSS, honing skills in styling and layout design.
- **Responsive Web Design:** Overcoming challenges with responsive design enhanced my understanding of creating websites that adapt to various screen sizes.
- **GitHub Collaboration:** Navigating GitHub setup challenges underscored the importance of version control in collaborative projects.

### Positive Reflections
I had a great time working on this project. In addition to letting me put my theoretical knowledge to use, it gave me a platform to experiment and learn about various facets of web development. It has been really satisfying to learn HTML and to feel more comfortable with CSS.

### Future Directions

Although the project was successful, it might be improved in the future by accurately setting up the project and starting with % instead of pixels. This could entail looking into adding new features to increase user engagement or improving the responsive design even more.

To sum up, the project was a fascinating and rewarding experience that greatly improved my HTML and CSS abilities. I'm excited to use these abilities in upcoming tasks and to keep learning about the exciting world of web development.
